The year is 20XX. A virus has infected our robotic armies and a lone cyborg must run to find the evil hacker behind this. Our unnamed hero has two skills to save us: shooting and jumping. Help him evade the infected robot army by dodging or destroying each one that comes after you. Dynamic enemies and environments change the game each time you play. Only one cyborg can save us, Shooty Jumpy Boy!
